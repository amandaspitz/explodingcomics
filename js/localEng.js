    text: "Yeap. We're back.  Its been a long time and much has changed. Throughout the past few years, I must have thought about Exploding Comics every single day. But it was last week when I was browsing TikTok, that a person I knew from the Dublin conventions commented saying he still missed my comics, that a fire started inside of me, and I thought: What the heck am I doing with my life, if not creating comics? This is part of what I have been since I was like 4. So I decided to combine the fact that I've been passionately studying software development, with the fact that I am a cartoonist and put EC back on track. If you are an old-time reader, I should tell you that everything is quite different, but as I noticed over the couple of storyboards I sketched, my sense of humor and punchline style have been pretty much the same. Can you expect more of the same? Yes. Also, my comics have always been 95% biographical, unless someone was writing the script for me. So I might have to tell you about a lot of not-so-funny situations and major changes I've been through. Still, if you're into simple, nonchalant small stories, this is your place. I missed you guys. A lot. One last thing: I put this whole text inside of a string in Javascript so the text won't have paragraphs 'till tomorrow. xD",

    text: "Good morning people. I boldly put a bit of an archive of comics to get the page going, which will make me regret and curse once I run out of material to publish. From now on, the page should run on one comic per week, as it used to five years ago. You know, the internet is a strange place now. People read like fifty pages per minute, and I believe a page that publishes once a week will barely keep the usual readers interested, let alone attract new visitors. Im shoving this page down my friends and families throats. But as previously mentioned, this time Im not trying to break into the market or make my living out of it, so a lot of the pressure is off. This is like blogging about my dogs life, but with pictures. I am so happy and satisfied with all the positive feedback. I am also sooo happy to practice coding, and I am pretty satisfied with the work Ive done here so far. ATM I live in Curitiba, probably the best city in the world. I live in a tiny flat in a huge building, where I met some of the best friends a person could have. I have an amazing day job where I work alongside awesome people (ohhh, and they have a dress code, and its all black and white). Furthermore, I noticed a brutal change on my creative work, and even on my coding assignments. I do not feel like Im rushing to meet deadlines any more, I just feel like doing the things because I want to do them. My schedule is normally organized, and I dont feel like I am constantly letting myself down. I have a suspicion that I owe that to my incredible therapist, who has been with me for the past four years. (Still no paragraphs cause javascript told me so). ",

We had some trouble to match the schedule with the angel who rescued her from the streets, but one Saturday I woke up and called her and she was coming to the city center so she decided to bring Garoa along. We were supposed to meet her to later decide whether we would adopt her or not, but we left home to meet up with the lady and casually bought a bag of dog food, dog biscuits, a little dog bed and some toys. Just because. She parked her car, Garoa got off, got the biscuits pack with her mouth and just pulled the leash towards the house, like she had lived with us all her life. This angel is called Meire, she does an amazing job with an association called Amor Sem Ra√ßa. If you are interested in helping her out, instagram.com/amorsemracaassociacao is her instagram. I plan on structuring a whole section of the website dedicated to helping her out, as she changes so many lives by rescuing dogs from the street and making her best to give each one a loving home.",

    text: "This is actually self-plagiarism. I wrote this very comic for old Exploding Comics when I first explored the idea of adding a pet as a third character back in the day. I don't like the old storyboards, I think my storytelling style was not quite there yet. I've been redrawing some of the comics that were already posted (looking at you 1 and 5), because I drew some of them in a hurry. About the website: look at the amazing job I did putting up Portuguese and English options with a button and all! (LIES - I asked the frontend senior that sits by my side to code the entire thing for me). However, he did use Javascript Vanilla cause that's what I was going for, but I will recode the whole website myself (this time I will do it myself, I promise) in React, so I will probably fuck up some things along the week. Bear with me, this thing will be a beauty once it's ready.",

So as many of you know, I started running a side project called Very Terrible Monsters, and you can find it on vtm dot explodingcomics dot com. I have been as busy as it gets, trying to make two webcomics work while I try to learn Object Orientation, and MY BROTHER I do not wish this on my worst enemy. I am going to be rather busy for the next couple of weeks trying to translate the goddamn classes into something that I can understand, but the good news is that I have on month and a half of strips prepared. So you will not run out of explodingcomics to read. Unfortunately I can't say the same for VTm, as it is a more mature project, way out of my comfort zone and much harder for me to make it work. Oh. Because I am not overwhelmed enough, I am also running a DnD adventure that was supposed to be every fortnight but turned weekly cause everyone is too excited.",
